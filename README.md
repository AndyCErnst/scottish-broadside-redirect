# scottish-broadside-redirect

This project is just to redirect people from the old url of the Scottish Broadsides website (https://darling-halva-fe09f3.netlify.app) to the new one (https://broadsides.netlify.app/). Netlify likely supports domain redirects on the premium option, but this is the quick and free way to redirect.
